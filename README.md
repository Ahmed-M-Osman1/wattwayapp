This is a new [**WattWay**](https://wattway.vercel.app/) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.


## Quick Start

First of all, you need to clone the project and install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

Next, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn
```
then go to IOS folder and run
```bash
pod install
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

### For building APK

go to android: 

```bash
cd android
```

then, run build using gradle

```bash
./gradlew bundle
```
